# Super Easy Guide to Using the Email Generator

Hello! This guide will help you use the Remote.com Email Generator even if you've never used a computer program before!

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following commands:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd remote-email-generator
```

Replace `<repository-url>` with the actual URL of the git repository.

### 2. Install Dependencies

Once you're in the project directory, install all required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

Create an environment file by copying the example:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

On Windows, use this command instead:
```bash
copy .env.example .env
```

### 4. Configure API Keys

Open the `.env` file in any text editor and add your API keys:

```
EXA_API_KEY=your_exa_api_key_here
```

Replace `your_exa_api_key_here` with your actual EXA API key.

### 5. Build the Project

Compile the TypeScript code to JavaScript:

```bash
npm run build
